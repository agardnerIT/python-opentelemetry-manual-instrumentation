This tutorial is a perfect first introduction to manual instrumenting your Python code with OpenTelemetry.

It is under 5 minutes long and by the end, your first spans will be getting shown in the console. Don't worry if you don't know what a Span is, I'll discuss that in the video.

In the second tutorial, we begin to enrich spans by setting important metadata such as the span status, adding span attributes, resources and also attaching span events.
